    "This project uses the Surprise package from scikit with Amazon review data of Luxury Beauty products to build a recommendation system. In this analysis, we find that out of KNN methods, Singular Value Decomposition, and Alternating Least Squares methods, Singular Value Decomposition was the best performing model for our selected data. We also examine what the optimal hyperparameters are for this particular dataset."

    "Our client is a beauty product retailer that currently carries a small handful of Amazon's top featured brands and products. We want to optimize a recommender system based on Amazon reviews that as accurately as possible predicts other products that customers would be likely to enjoy. Using this optimized recommender system, we will move forward with the goal of using our client's customer preferences to extract insights into what other brands/products would be successful if our client were to add them to their product offering.\n",
