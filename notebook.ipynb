    "This project uses the Surprise package from scikit with Amazon review data of Luxury Beauty products to build a recommendation system. For this analysis, we will examine the performance of memory-based collaborative filtering in the form of K-Nearest Neighbors, as well as of model-based collaborative filtering in the form of Singular Value Decomposition. From our test results, we find that out of KNN methods, Singular Value Decomposition, and Alternating Least Squares methods, Singular Value Decomposition was the best performing model for our selected data. We also examine what the optimal hyperparameters are for this particular dataset."

    "\n",
    "Our client is a beauty product retailer that wants to know what the most popular products on Amazon are, as well as what other products customers would be likely to give high ratings to, under the assumption that they would give high ratings to these popular products. We want to optimize a recommender system based on Amazon reviews that as accurately as possible predicts other products that customers would be likely to enjoy. Using this optimized recommender system, we will move forward with the goal of using our client's customer preferences to extract insights into what other brands/products would be successful if our client were to add them to their product offering.\n",

    "* Assuming that our client's customers currently give high ratings to the popular products on Amazon, what other products can we recommend adding to inventory?\n",

It also looks like our final SVD model has a lower RMSE score than even our best performing KNN Baseline model, so we will move forward to building our recommender system using the SVD model with the best parameters found in our final gridsearch. We can also see that our MAE score is 0.9229, meaning that in terms of rating stars, the average error of our model is off by 0.9229 stars from the actual rating."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "And there we have our final product recommendations! We can see that the Singular Value Decomposition had the best performance with respect to RMSE. Upon running a series of gridsearches, we were also able to determine the optimal hyperparameters to further reduce the RMSE score. \n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret our error, we looked at the MAE score which was 0.9237 on our final best model, meaning that  the average error of our model is off by 0.9237 stars from the actual rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we built out functions to help us look up product codes to put into a recommender system which would then provide us with however many product recommendations the user desires.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of this project lies in the ability to use Amazon's huge amount of ratings data to identify what other products a smaller retailer might want to consider adding to their inventory. The only additional data that we would need from the retailer would be customer preferences on the products that the retailer currently carries and that the customer would give high ratings to, and we can place this information in the context of Amazon's ratings to determine what other products this customer would be likely to give high ratings to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation to this analysis is that the dataset only contains beauty products under the \"Luxury Beauty\" category, which is a collection of approved brands. Amazon also has a category labeled \"All Beauty\" whose data we have omitted in this analysis due to hardware limitations that would occur under the stress of dealing with the such a large size of these combined datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, here are the final recommendations for our client:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In order to build a similar recommender system, SVD would be the best algorithm to use, with the following hyperparameters: lr_all=0.025, n_epochs=50, n_factors=150, reg_all=0.1\n",
    "2. Client should carry the following products based on popularity on Amazon:\n",
    "* TOPPIK Hair Building Fibers\n",
    "* HOT TOOLS Professional 24k Gold Extra-Long Barrel Curling Iron/Wand\n",
    "* Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater\n",
    "* OPI Nail Lacquer, Cajun Shrimp\n",
    "* OPI Nail Lacquer, Not So Bora-Bora-ing Pink\n",
    "* BaBylissPRO Ceramix Xtreme Dryer\n",
    "* OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener\n",
    "* Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assuming that our client's current customers would give high ratings to those products, our client should also consider carrying the following products:\n",
    "* Crabtree & Evelyn - Gardener's Ultra-Moisturising Hand Therapy Pump\n",
    "* Crabtree & Evelyn Hand Soap, Gardeners\n",
    "* Soy Milk Hand Crme\n",
    "* Paul Mitchell Shampoo One\n",
    "* Glytone Rejuvenating Mask\n",
    "* PCA SKIN Protecting Hydrator Broad Spectrum SPF 30\n",
    "* jane iredale Amazing Base Loose Mineral Powder\n",
    "* jane iredale So-Bronze, Bronzing Powder\n",
    "* YU-Be: Japan’s secret for dry skin relief. Deep hydrating moisturizing cream for face, hand and body\n",
    "* Calvin Klein ETERNITY Eau de Parfum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ALS has been proven to be an effective algorithm in recommender systems, it was surprising to see such a poor performance score with the data used in this analysis. Moving forward, it might be a worthwhile investigation to see how the model performs if we combine data from the \"All Beauty\" category with the data used in this analysis."
